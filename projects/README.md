# Projects

Long-form case studies that tell a story from design through validation. Recommended structure for each project:
1. **Context** — business drivers, constraints, success metrics.
2. **Architecture** — topology diagram, technology choices, redundancy considerations.
3. **Implementation** — configs, automation artifacts, deployment sequencing.
4. **Validation** — test plan, results, monitoring dashboards.
5. **Postmortem** — issues encountered, risk assessment, future improvements.

Ideas to tackle:
- secure-branch-connectivity — SD-WAN design with integrated firewall policies.
- zero-trust-campus — NAC, segmentation, and micro-perimeter controls.
- incident-response-tabletop — Simulated attack, detection, response, lessons learned.
