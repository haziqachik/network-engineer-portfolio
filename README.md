# Network Engineering & Security Portfolio

I'm building a job-ready portfolio that showcases hands-on networking and security skills while I prepare for network engineer and network security engineer roles.

## Target Roles
- Network Engineer (routing, switching, automation)
- Network Security Engineer (firewalls, IDS/IPS, incident response)
- Cloud Networking Specialist (hybrid connectivity, secure design)

## Current Focus
- Refreshing core routing & switching (OSPF, BGP, STP)
- Hardening edge security (firewalls, VPNs, ACL strategy)
- Automating routine tasks with Python and Ansible
- Practicing incident response and log analysis workflows

## Repository Layout
- labs/ - Guided exercises with configs, packet captures, validation notes
- projects/ - End-to-end case studies, architecture diagrams, retrospectives
- notes/ - Certification prep, RFC takeaways, tooling cheat sheets
- communications/ - Post-incident reports, design briefs, stakeholder updates
- automation/ - Scripts, Ansible playbooks, validation harnesses
- journal.md - Dated log of progress, lessons learned, next targets

Each lab or project includes:
1. Problem statement and design goals
2. Reference topology or diagram
3. Implementation details (configs, scripts, validation commands)
4. Risk assessment and future improvements

## Roadmap
| Sprint | Theme | Key Deliverables |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Week 1 | Core routing refresh | Lab: OSPF multi-area, Project: Document enterprise LAN baseline |
| Week 2 | Security hardening | Lab: Firewall segmentation, Notes: Zero Trust primer |
| Week 3 | Automation | Scripts: Ansible for VLAN provisioning, Lab: Config drift detection |
| Week 4 | Monitoring and IR | Project: Incident response tabletop, Communications: Post-incident report |

The roadmap will evolve as I iterate. I'll keep a running changelog in journal.md and use GitHub Issues or Projects to queue upcoming work.

## How to Navigate
- Start with journal.md for the latest update.
- Dive into labs/ for focused technical reps.
- Review projects/ for holistic case studies and architecture narratives.
- Check automation/ for repeatable tooling you can reuse or extend.

## Tooling and Environment
- Primary lab tooling: EVE-NG or GNS3, Cisco Packet Tracer, open-source firewall platforms
- Automation stack: Python 3.11, Ansible, Netmiko or NAPALM
- Observability: Wireshark, Zeek, ELK stack (lab builds)

## Feedback and Collaboration
I welcome feedback, issue reports, or collaboration ideas. Open a GitHub Issue, or reach out via LinkedIn (add your profile link here) to discuss networking projects, incident response drills, or sharing lab resources.
