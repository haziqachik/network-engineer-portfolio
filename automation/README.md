# Automation

Reusable scripts and playbooks that streamline network and security operations. Organize by tooling:
- nsible/ — Playbooks and roles for device configuration, compliance checks, backup jobs.
- python/ — Netmiko/NAPALM scripts for inventory, configuration drift, health checks.
- alidation/ — Test harnesses, pytest suites, or Batfish snapshots to prove intent.

Add a equirements.txt or Pipfile when Python dependencies grow, and document how to run each automation artifact in its own README.
